<h1>HTML Question</h1>
<h2> Allen Clark Nelson Jr</h2>
<h3>What are &lt;meta&gt; elements in html? Where are they used? Provide two examples.</h3>
<p>A meta element is data that describes the documents author, keyword or description. 
It is used within the html document and will not be shown on the actual page. 
Two examples are meta name = description and meta charset= "UTF-8.</p>
<h3>Briefly describe the correct usage of the following HTML5 semantic elements: &lt;header&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;.
Provide an example of each.</h3> 
<p>
<ol>
<li>Header is used as a header for the document. Example: Reasons why HTML is awesome.</li>
<li>Article is for independent text. Example: Apples are the best fruit.</li>
<li>Section is used for sections of the document such as chapters and footers. Example: &lt;section&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Cookies&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;/section&gt;</li>
<li>Footer is used for the footer for the document. Example: &copy;Allen Clark Nelson Jr.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Explain the impact, if any, of casing (upper vs. lower) and white space inside your HTML code. How about the impact of casing and spacing within your file naming conventions?</h3>
<p>HTML views white space as one individual space instead of how many spaces that you have inserted. 
The impact of using upper case instead of lower case in file naming is huge, if you accidently upper case the file name and another page tries to link to a lower case version of that file than nothing would happen.</p> 
<h3>What is the difference between <em><strong>http://</strong></em> used to retrieve a webpage in a browser, and <em><strong>ftp://</strong></em> used to upload pages to the server?</h3>
<ul> 
	<li>Ftp was used before http</li>
	<li>Ftp is only used to transfer files</li>
	<li>Http loads the page in the actual webbrowser</li>
</ul>
<h3>Definitions(in my own words)</h3>
<ul>
	<li>HTML - HTML is the code used to create the bones to a website.</li>
	<li>CSS - CSS is used to style the website that you create with HTML.</li>
	<li>JavaScript - JavaScript is what you use to create functions like buttons on your website.</li>
</ul>
